# Router

This is a simple routing library for use with the
[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) framework.

## Usage

```clojure
(ns com.example.app
  (:require [com.fkretlow.router :refer [compile-router]]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]])

;; Assuming you have request handlers get-root, get-items etc. defined
;; and available at this point:
(def app-routes ["/" 
                 :get get-root,
                 ["/items"
                  :get get-items,
                  :post post-items,
                  ["/{id}"
                   :get get-item,
                   :delete delete-item]]])

(run-jetty (compile-router app-routes)
           {:port 3000, :join? false})
```
